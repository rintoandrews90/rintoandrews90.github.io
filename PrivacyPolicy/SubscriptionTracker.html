    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and store your information
        when you use our subscription tracking application ("the App").

        <li>Subscription-related data (service name, price, billing cycle)</li>
        <li>App usage data required for functionality</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Processing</h2>
    <p>
        All user data is stored and processed using <strong>Supabase</strong>,
        a third-party backend and database service.
    </p>
    <p>
        Supabase manages the infrastructure and security of the stored data
        according to their own privacy and security policies.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The App uses Supabase for authentication and data storage.
        We do not sell or share your personal data for advertising purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        We rely on Supabase’s industry-standard security measures to protect your data.
        However, no online service can guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
        The developer is not responsible for any data leaks, breaches, or unauthorized
        access caused by third-party services, infrastructure failures, cyber attacks,
        or circumstances beyond reasonable control.
    </p>

    <h2>7. User Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
        You are responsible for keeping your login credentials secure.
        The developer is not liable for data loss caused by compromised user accounts
        or devices.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>
        Your data is retained while your account is active.
        You may request account and data deletion, subject to technical limitations.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
